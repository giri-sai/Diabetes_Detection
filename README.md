# Diabetes-Detection-Data-Science
In this project classification models are built to predict if a patient has diabetes or no from the specific diagnostic measures from the data set.
Objective of the project: To predict from the given dataset if a particular patient has diabetes or no based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

Data description: The dataset consists of 8 medical predictor variables and one target/outcome variable (class). Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
 
The dataset consists of 767 rows and 9 columns.

Successfully handled the null values, special characters, outliers using pandas. 

Performed Exploratory data analysis on the data to bring out significant insights and relationships.

Handled overfitting by using k-fold cross validation technique and got the test accuracy of the model as 71.97.

Increased the performance of the model by 9 percent summing up the accuracy as 80 percent.
